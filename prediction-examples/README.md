# uv-virus-inactivation-prediction

# 'prediction-examples' folder

# The purpose of this folder is to provide examples of how to predict the UV inactivation rate constants of dsDNA and/or (+) ssRNA viruses of interest. 

# Users wanting to predict inactivation of viruses with our optimized models (as described in: ) should use the files here as a starting point for predictions. Only the optimal (+) ssRNA virus model and dsDNA virus model are set up for prediction here.

# File structure within the 'dsdna' and 'plusssrna' folders are the same.
